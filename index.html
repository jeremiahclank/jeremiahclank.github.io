<p>Concept</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EzOdNCc_t8">Link: Introduction Philippines</a>
<p id="tutorial-text">I want to introduce what Filipino culture is for those who wants to learn about this ethnicity. Also, telling them what language what Filpinos speak because there are different kinds of language in the Philppines. I want to show them the history about Filipino ups and downs they faced over the years. Telling the audience why they should go to the Philippines atlease once because the enivronment is different here in United States. Also the food is really good and delicious food.</p>

<p id="tutorial-text">I want to hold a class to teach them how to speack simple words in tagalog when they go to Philppines for vacation. When my students learns how to speack simple words to the Filipinos in the Philippines, the Filipinos will be suprised. Filipinos will be suprised when tourist are speacking in tagalog. Also, seeing the beautiful tourist destination. Tourist will see the difference between how Philippines operate from where their home lands. Also teaching them what kinds of food in Philippines because there are different kinds of food that comes with rice.</p>

<p>Charity</p>
<p id="tutorial-text">The charity that I want to raise is to do the fundraiser is to raiseing money to give it to those who needs money, food, supplies, and etc. Raising money to help the everyone in the Philippines who needs help from diffcult times. Teaching classes to help out even a small portion helps in a big way to help people in the Philippines. Especially the children who are straving without having money to buy food for thenselves or to their family to survive. 
</p>
<p>This really helps me out because when I went to the Philippines two years ago, I feel bad for the families who are living in a small house with a lot of family members and friends in one tiny place. Also, it opened my eyes seeing everyone in the motherland, Philippines, living here is really diffcult than living in United States. Helping the needed in the Philippines will change the their lives for. I am proud to be a Filipino-American and helping others will change my life forever as well. Teaching to all Filipino-American, Filipinos, and non-Filipinos to learn, grow, helping one another about Filipino Culture and history.</p>

<p>What does culture mean to you and what is it important to be culturally competent?</p>
<p>This culture means to me is that learning about my culture are proud and knowing their belifs and faith in this world. Learning about my faith and praying all the time will help me through good and bad times that is happening to me, my family, friends, and the world that is going on in life. Life isn't easy to beign with because everyday is a challenge and unexpected in the future that is ahead. Learning about Filipinos in the Philippines are interesting because we as Filipinos are hard working people like other ethnicity trying to work hard to support their families to teach their children to spread positivity.</p>
